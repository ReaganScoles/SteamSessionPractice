# SteamSessionPractice
A practice project in which I am learning how to create a Steam multiplayer game session capable of hosting multiple clients and connecting to the Steam subsystem using Unreal Engine 5. During the course of this project, I am following the Udemy course titled "Unreal Engine 5 C++ Multiplayer Shooter" by Stephen Ulibarri.
